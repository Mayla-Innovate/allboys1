    <h1>❤ For All The Boys I've Loved ❤️</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      Shy high school junior Lara Jean Covey writes letters to boys she feels an
      intense passion for before locking them away in her closet. Her most
      recent is to her childhood friend Josh, who was dating her older sister
      Margot until she moves to college, and breaks up with him. Lara Jean has
      always had a crush on Josh but decides it would not be okay to date him.
      One night, Lara Jean falls asleep on the couch while hanging out with her
      little sister, Kitty, who sneaks into her room and finds her collection of
      letters. The following Monday at school, Lara Jean is confronted by a
      former crush, Peter Kavinsky. He received the letter she had written him,
      causing her to faint. After waking up, she sees Josh approaching with his
      letter, and in a moment of panic, Lara Jean kisses Peter to throw Josh off
      before running away. Lara Jean then encounters another recipient of a
      letter, Lucas, who is gay, as she begins to realize that all the letters
      have been mailed out. She later left her house to avoid both Josh and
      Peter, but the latter appears at her favorite diner. She explains that the
      kiss was merely to dissuade Josh. Peter is surprisingly okay with this,
      and proposes that he and Lara Jean fake date to make his ex-girlfriend
      (Lara Jean's ex-best friend and nemesis) Gen jealous. She agrees, and the
      next few months go by with the whole school, along with their respective
      friends and families, believing they are dating. When Peter finds that Gen
      is actually jealous, he is himself conflicted. At the same time, Lara Jean
      finds herself jealous. On the school ski trip, Lara Jean and Peter
      confront each other about their true feelings, ending up kissing while
      alone in a hot tub.
